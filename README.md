# Logistic-regression-model-on-Titanic-dataset
Within the scope of this effort, we have attempted to speculate about one of two categories: survivors or fatalities. Using Logistic Regression in Python in order to do classification was the last step in completing the project.
We will utilise a version of the titanic data set that has been "semi-cleaned."
